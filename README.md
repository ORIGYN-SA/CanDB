# CanDB
This repository holds the code for the [CanDB](https://ykgs2-ziaaa-aaaak-qcfya-cai.icp0.io/) project. CanDB is a flexible, performant, and horizontally scalable non-relational multi-canister data store built for the Internet Computer.

CanDB was the 2nd place finisher in the Internet Computer Supernova Hackathon, hosted by DFINITY in June of 2022.

## Benchmarks

To view benchmarks for a single CanDB canister, see [https://github.com/internet-computer/candb-benchmarks](https://github.com/internet-computer/candb-benchmarks). CanDB is horizontally scalable, so these benchmarks keep constant performance as CanDB auto-scales, with the only limitation/bottleneck being simultaneous browser connection limits.
